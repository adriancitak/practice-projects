        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I graduated from Purdue University in Interdisciplinary Engineering with a minor in Entrepreneurship (2019). After graduation I temporarily came back to Turkey to help my mother with her consulting business.</p>
        <p>During this time, I also started a brand called Vitaljoy with the goal of helping people lose weight and become stronger. Through this project I dove deep into the land of fitness, behavior change and nutrition. In fact, I even wrote a book on the topic! I grew this brand to hundreds of customers and over 6000 Instagram followers.</p>
        <p>While that was an incredible and rewarding journey, I missed being "technical". I would always have these ideas and ask myself, "I wonder how long would this take to code?" but they never materialized because of my lack of abilities. So, I made a promise to myself that I would master coding.</p>
        <p>I started learning to code at the very end of 2024. While still continuously learning, happy to say that I have made lots of progress!</p>
